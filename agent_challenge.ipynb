    "# NLP, RAG, and Agent Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This three-part exercise evaluates your ability to integrate natural language processing, retrieval-augmented generation, and custom agent design. \n",
    "  - You’ll demonstrate end-to-end proficiency—from data ingestion and normalization, to building a RAG system, to orchestrating an intelligent “recruiting agent” that combines tools and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This test is designed to assess your problem-solving approach, coding skills, and thought process. There are no right or wrong answers—just follow your instincts and provide your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Guidelines:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work Independently:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Do not rely on external generative AI assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, LLaMA) for code generation or design decisions.\n",
    "  - Implement all solutions yourself, drawing on your own understanding and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain Data Privacy:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Keep all sample data and code within your local environment.\n",
    "  - Do not share any files or information on public platforms (GitHub, Google Drive, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document Your Thought Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For each step, submit both your code and a concise write-up explaining your approach, design trade-offs, and any assumptions made.\n",
    "  - Focus on clarity, modularity, and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adhere to Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Write clean, well-structured code with meaningful variable names and comments where needed."
